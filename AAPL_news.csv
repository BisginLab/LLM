This move was narrower than the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.8%. Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 0.76%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 1.18%.
Prior to today's trading, shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products had lost 4.02% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.11% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.4% in that time.
The upcoming earnings release of Apple will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.08, reflecting a 10.64% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $117.31 billion, reflecting a 0.13% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.
For the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.56 per share and a revenue of $393.42 billion, signifying shifts of +7.01% and +2.65%, respectively, from the last year.
Furthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Apple. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.
The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained steady. Apple is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(Reuters) - Apple has agreed to settle a lawsuit accusing the company of knowingly letting scammers exploit its gift cards, and keep stolen funds for itself.
According to a filing on Wednesday in federal court in San Jose, California, Apple and the plaintiffs have agreed on material settlement terms after working with a mediator.
They are drafting a formal settlement to be presented to U.S. District Judge Edward Davila for preliminary approval.
Apple and lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The scam involves fraudsters who instill panic or urgency by insisting by phone that victims buy App Store and iTunes gift cards or Apple Store gift cards in order to pay for taxes, hospital and utility bills, bail and debt collection.
Victims are then told to share the codes on the backs of the cards, despite a warning on the cards that reads: ""Do not share your code with anyone you do not know.""
According to the complaint, Apple would typically deposit only 70% of the stolen funds into fraudsters' bank accounts, and keep 30% for itself as a ""commission"" for knowingly converting stolen codes into dollars.
Victims likely lost ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" in the scam, the complaint said.
The lawsuit covered anyone in the United States who from 2015 through July 31, 2020 bought gift cards redeemable on iTunes or the App Store, provided codes to fraudsters, and did not receive refunds from Apple.
In June 2022, Davila rejected Apple's bid to dismiss the lawsuit.
He said the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that the Cupertino, California-based company's effort to disclaim liability, even after victims claimed they were scammed, was unconscionable.

AAPL
), will soon descend upon Las Vegas for CES 2024. The annual consumer electronics trade show, which runs from Jan. 9 through Jan. 12, serves as a showcase for the biggest technology trends that will likely make their way into our lives.
Over the years that’s included everything from high-end vehicle infotainment systems and 4K, OLED TVs to electric scooters and new computer chips. Of course, there’s also the collection of oddities that flood the show’s various booths and displays. Think talking toilets and forks that tell you if you’re eating too fast.
And CES 2024 looks set to pack even more of the equal parts impressive and downright confounding products that will end up in our living rooms and driveways in the months and years to come. Naturally, Yahoo Finance will be live on the ground in Sin City, weaving through the thousands of attendees to bring you all of the latest news from the big show.
So, what can you expect out of CES 2024? Funny you should ask…
AI will be the talk of the show
The AI revolution that dominated headlines in 2023 will continue to roll on in 2024.You can expect everyone from chipmakers and automotive companies to TV manufacturers and more to talk up the benefits of AI during the big show.
One of the biggest themes is likely to be based around the AI PC. AMD (
AMD
), Intel (
INTC
), and Qualcomm (
QCOM
) have each debuted their own AI PC chips in recent months, with Intel showing off its Core Ultra AI PC processors in December.
The idea behind AI PCs is to add AI processing capabilities to laptop and desktop chips so that users can run AI applications on their own computers rather than in the cloud. The thinking is that if you need to run sensitive data like personal information or corporate files through an AI program, doing so on your computer is safer than sending them up to the cloud.

 (ASSOCIATED PRESS)
But beyond that, companies are still trying to figure out how AI PCs will benefit most people. During Intel’s December AI Everywhere event, company representatives said that it’ll be up to developers to come up with new apps and programs that take advantage of new AI PC features.
Story continues
Chipmakers won’t be the only companies focusing on AI. Automakers, retailers, and home appliance manufacturers will undoubtedly explain how they’re using AI to power their latest and greatest products.
AI will likely be so ubiquitous at CES 2024 that it’ll be strange if a company doesn’t mention the technology. Heck, Samsung says that it’s 
bringing AI to its kitchen appliances
, including its refrigerators.
More cars than a dealership
It’s cliche to say that CES is as much a car show as it is a technology event. Automakers from across the world pack the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center with their hottest cars, trucks, SUVs, and, occasionally, flying cars, filling the air with the smell of fresh rubber and the promise of a future where you can watch TV while your vehicle chauffeurs you around town.
In past years companies ranging from Ford (
F
) and BMW to Hyundai (
HYMTF
) and Chevy (
GM
) have debuted new in-car technologies designed to improve the driving experience. Last year BMW revealed a concept for a customizable kind of paint job that you can adjust at any time. That same year, Sony (
SONY
) and Honda (
HMC
) unveiled their concept car Afeela. This year Sony Honda Mobility will be back with a prototype of the Afeela.

As for the flying cars, Uber (
UBER
) and Hyundai teamed up to announce their flying taxi at CES 2020. This year Hyundai Motor Group’s Advanced Air Mobility company, Supernal, will take the wraps off of its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle complete with a vertiport exhibit that will showcase how passengers will ride in the flying concept.
TVs get smarter and brighter
TVs are a mainstay of CES. They’re also my favorite part of the show. Where else can you see every next-generation television you’ll beg your spouse to get in one place?
The biggest trend in TVs is microLED technology, which promises the color of OLED sets with the brightness of LED systems. So far, however, those TVs have been incredibly expensive, with prices in the tens of thousands of dollars. But that’s expected to come down over time, and could eventually become relatively affordable for the average consumer.

TVs are also getting more AI capabilities, as well. 
LG announced on Jan. 3
 that its latest OLED TVs will feature updated AI processors that improve image and sound quality. The company also said that its wireless television, which it debuted at CES 2023, will now be available with a smaller 65-inch screen. There’s also a larger 97-inch model that, well, just won’t fit in my Queens apartment.
Lots of weird and wild products
One of the best parts of CES is seeing so many wild, attention-grabbing products in one place. Some of them are practical, like leak detectors for under your kitchen sink and Wi-Fi-enabled meat thermometers that send you an alert on your phone when your steak is ready. Some aren’t so practical; I’m looking at you, electric roller skates.
I’ve seen more weird gadgets and gizmos over the years than I can count, and CES 2024 will be no different. And I’ll be bringing you all of that and more when the big show kicks off. Stay tuned.

By 11:40 ET (14:45 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up over 200 points, or 0.7%, the S&P 500 traded 19 points, or 0.4%, higher, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 23 points or 0.2%.
Labor market shows resilience
Data released earlier Thursday showed that U.S. private employers added far more roles than expected in December, pointing to lingering resilience in the labor market that may impact how Federal Reserve policymakers approach potential interest rate reductions this year.
Private payrolls
 came in at 164,000 last month, rising from a downwardly revised mark of 101,000 in November, according to data from payrolls processor ADP. Economists had predicted a reading of 115,000.
While the strength of the labor market could cause the Fed to think twice about cutting interest rates early in 2024, the data also showed that pay growth, an important contributor to overall inflation, eased to 5.4% from a rate of 5.6% a month earlier, extending a deceleration that started in September 2022.
These figures will serve as a precursor to the publication of the all-important December 
nonfarm payrolls
 report on Friday, which could drive risk sentiment for the immediate future.
Walgreens slashes its dividend
In the corporate sector, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) stock slumped over 10% in the early part of the session after the drugstore chain slashed its quarterly dividend by 48%, in a move Chief Executive Officer Tim Wentworth said was necessary to ""strengthen our long-term balance sheet and cash position.""
Ford (NYSE:F) stock initially fell 0.5% before rising after the auto giant posted a 7.1% rise in 2023 U.S. sales, fueled by demand for its crossover SUVs and pickup trucks and easing supply chain constraints.
Story continues
Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) stock fell 2% after the packaged foods company cut organic net sales growth and profit forecasts for fiscal 2024 and warned of a slower recovery in demand for its produce.
Crude steadies amid Middle East supply concerns
Oil prices initially stabilized Thursday after the previous session’s sharp gains on continued concerns over supply from the Middle East.
By 09:45 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.2% higher at $72.55 a barrel. However, as of 11:45 ET, they now trade 1.75% lower at $71.40 a barrel. The Brent contract climbed 0.4% to $77.92 a barrel before falling 1.8% to $76.81.
Both contracts surged around 3% on Wednesday after protests over high fuel prices caused Libya’s El Sahara oil field to halt production, with the field producing about 300,000 barrels per day.
This added to ongoing concerns over Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis targeting shipping in the Red Sea.
The market was also supported by data from the 
American Petroleum Institute
, showing U.S. crude stocks fell by a bigger-than-expected 7.4 million barrels last week.
Official data from the 
Energy Information Administration
 is due later Thursday, delayed by a day due to Monday’s New Year's holiday.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.2% to $2,045.80/oz, while EUR/USD is trading 0.3% higher at 1.0955.

The year 2024 is off to a tough start for Apple. In the day-and-a-half that the stock market has been open this year, the iPhone maker's stock has fallen by nearly 5%.
If the decline holds by the time the market closes Wednesday, that will represent a loss of more than $120 billion in market value in just two days. Two very expensive days.
The immediate cause of the drubbing 
was a downgrade by Barclays on Tuesday
, hitting Apple's stock with an ""underweight"" rating (analyst-speak for ""sell""). The downgrade was a manifestation of deeper investor unease with the company's prospects.
Apple's overall revenue has declined for four consecutive quarters, and the company has hinted at modest expectations for holiday sales. The iPhone, which accounts for nearly half of Apple's revenue, is facing stiffer competition in China, and the Apple Watch is locked in a patent fight that 
forced Apple to halt sales of certain models
 in the U.S. for a few days last year.
If things look bleak for the Cupertino, Calif., company, there are a few bright spots on the horizon:
Apple's services business continues to be an underappreciated giant. According to Apple bull Dan Ives's ""sum of the parts"" analysis, the services business is worth $1.5 trillion to $1.6 trillion on a standalone basis.
The 
VisionPro, Apple's $3,500 mixed reality headset,
 is due to go on sale this year. The company is treading cautiously with a very limited rollout of the new device—so sales of the VisionPro this year will not move the needle for Apple. But if consumers cotton to the device, it could provide a much-needed jolt of excitement to Apple's image that translates into broader sales.
Finally, Apple has yet to show its cards in the high-stakes game of generative AI. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple has 
developed its own large language model
 and has been internally testing an ""Apple GPT"" chatbot based on it for months.

’s GOOGL Google is making advancements to add features to its original Pixel Watch.
A month ago, it was announced that this particular smartwatch would be upgraded with some of the features of the Pixel Watch 2. It has now started featuring DND and Bedtime Mode sync.
Users can avail of these features by opening the Pixel Watch companion app.
Alphabet’s solid efforts to strengthen its Pixel Watch series are expected to continue helping it bolster its presence in the booming smartwatch market.
Per a Fortune Business Insights report, the global smartwatch market is anticipated to reach $77.22 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 14.8% between 2023 and 2030.
The company’s growing prospects in this promising market are expected to aid it in gaining investors’ optimism in the days ahead.
Growth promises associated with Pixel Watches are expected to contribute well to the performance of Google Services segment which has been the key growth driver of the company.
Alphabet’s shares have gained 56.2% in the past year, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 53.1%.
Growing Google Services segment is expected to continue driving its overall performance.
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues is pegged at $283.39 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.3%.
The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pinned at $6.74 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.6%. The estimate has been revised upward by 0.7% in the past 30 days.
Competitive Scenario
Although Alphabet is a late entrant in this market, its growing smartwatch efforts are likely to intensify competition for other incumbents that are leaving no stone unturned to expand footprint in the smartwatch market, like 
Apple 
AAPL and 
Garmin 
GRMN.
Apple, currently dominating the smartwatch market on the back of its expanding Watch family, is constantly making efforts to sustain its supremacy. The strong adoption of the Apple Watch on the back of useful and advanced features like Cycle Tracking, the Noise app and Activity Trends remains a major positive.
The company recently announced the availability of watchOS 10 to further strengthen the Apple Watch series.
More than two-thirds of the customers who purchased the Apple Watch during fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 were first-time customers.
Garmin’s expanding product portfolio for the Fitness and Outdoor business, which has been built with both internal development efforts and acquisitions, makes the company a potential player in the wearable space.
The launch of its new health and fitness smartwatch called vivoactive 5 and GPS smartwatches, namely the Venu 3 and Venu 3S, remains noteworthy.
These devices are comprised of robust healthcare features like sleep coach, which offers a sleep score and personalized coaching that keeps track of different sleep stages, naps, Pulse Ox1 and heart rate variability (“HRV”) status; morning report, which provides an overview of sleep, recovery and HRV status; nap detection, which tracks or logs naps automatically and Body Battery enhancements, which monitor energy levels throughout the day.

notable downgrade from Barclays
 (
NYSE:BCS
) to Sell from Hold.
Undoubtedly, Sell ratings are few and far between on Wall Street these days. So, the downgrade was enough to send shivers down the spines of investors of the iPhone maker and Magnificent Seven holding, whose magnificence is sure to be tested (and perhaps questioned) throughout the year.
Indeed, Apple isn’t a $3 trillion company anymore after more than $100 billion in market cap was wiped out in a day.
Though five-star-rated Barclays analyst Tim Long had his fair share of reasons for the downgrade (“lackluster” iPhone 15 sales in China, for one) and a price target of $160.00 — which entails more than 13% in downside from here — I think investors should view any such dip to such levels as more of a buying opportunity than a sign that it’s curtains for the Cupertino-based tech titan.
The iPhone 15 Underwhelms. The iPhone 16 May Not Be Much Better, Says Barclays
Besides weak iPhone 15 sales expectations, Long doesn’t see the next iPhone as a catalyst that could help Apple make up for lost time.
“We see no features of upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling,” Long said.
That downbeat note on the next iPhone is incredibly discouraging for investors. However, it’s quite a stretch to shoot down the next iPhone when we don’t know what the next device could feature.
Indeed, it seems like Apple stock seems to be heavily impacted by bearish notes than bullish ones. In a way, it’s the most unloved of the Magnificent Seven. For example, recently, Wedbush’s Daniel Ives touted Apple as a “
golden opportunity
” with a $4 trillion market cap in sight. Still, the stock didn’t surge 4% on that news. So, why the overweighting on the negatives? I guess it’s easier to be bearish on Apple stock than peers, who seem more than willing to serve investors what they want: AI announcements.
Story continues
All considered, I believe the negativity surrounding Apple is overdone, and I am staying bullish, just like Mr. Ives, a bull whose call is being drowned out by excess negativity and a more recent Barclays downgrade.
Why It Could Be a Mistake to Discount the iPhone 16’s Potential
For now, iPhone 16 features are surrounding items rotating in the rumor mill. As such, I don’t think it’s justified to dismiss the next iPhone as uncompelling. The iPhone 16 may not feature a game-changing design. That said, I do believe that hardware innovations could make the next iteration of the iPhone a pretty substantial upgrade, perhaps the largest upgrade in a few cycles.
The iPhone 16 is rumored to have the A18 chip, which could feature even more impressive graphical capabilities. Indeed, the current A17 Pro chip featured in iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models can already run some impressive triple-A game titles. Capcom’s 
Resident Evil 4 Remake
 and 
Resident Evil Village
 are ambitious titles that show the graphical firepower of Apple’s latest chip. Undoubtedly, the latest iPhone shows potential in the handheld gaming device market.
There’s one big problem, however. There simply aren’t enough triple-A titles for gamers to view the latest iPhone as a suitable alternative to the many PC-based handheld devices out there that can run a slew of titles. This could change once Apple is ready to pull the curtain on its latest iPhone 16 later this year.
Apple Entering a “New Era of Gaming,” Says Video Game Industry Visionary
For the iPhone 15 reveal, there was quite an emphasis on gaming. However, I believe that’s just an appetizer ahead of a main course. This year will see the launch of Apple Vision Pro, a device that could be propelled to the forefront by gaming announcements. Indeed, gaming continues to be a main attraction to the medium of spatial computing and the Metaverse.
If Apple can acquire a major gaming studio (something I suggested in a 
prior piece
) or pick up the pace of its gaming-related partnerships like the ones it made with Capcom and legendary game creator Hideo Kojima, I do not doubt that Apple could tap video games as a means to jolt Vision Pro, iPhone, and even Services sales growth.
Last year, Hideo Kojima made a bold statement, saying that Apple is entering a “new era of gaming.” As one of the brightest and most innovative minds in gaming, investors and gamers should not take such a statement lightly.
Is Apple Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?
On TipRanks, AAPL stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 31 analyst ratings, there are 23 Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The 
average AAPL stock price target
 is $203.04, implying upside potential of 10.1%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $150.00 per share to a high of $250.00 per share.
The Takeaway
It’s all too easy to be bearish on Apple stock right now and believe Barclays’ Tim Long over the likes of Wedbush’s Daniel Ives.
After Apple’s awful start to 2024, I believe the odds favor the bulls over the bears. Apple’s iPhone 15 may be running out of steam, but there are a lot of new devices (and perhaps some services) coming in 2024. I wouldn’t overlook them.

RACHELLE AKUFFO:
 All right. Well, Apple hit its lowest level in seven weeks after Barclays issued a rare downgrade on the stock citing weaker demand for the iPhone 15. But Goldman Sachs sang a different tune this morning saying the tech giant could stand to benefit from PC demand recovery. And with Apple's much anticipated virtual reality headset expected to be released this year, what should investors expect?
Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley joins us with the details. Dan, it seems like a lot riding on this year.
DAN HOWLEY:
 Yeah, that's right, Rachelle. We're seeing this-- obviously this note from Barclays yesterday impacting the stock price, sending it down about 3% throughout the day yesterday, and now we're seeing this kind of, as you said, opposite side of the coin. This Goldman piece saying that essentially an increase in PC demand will help Apple.
And so one of the weaker portions of Apple's business has been the Mac and iPad side of things, and that, like other PC manufacturers, comes down to when people purchase tons of new products as the pandemic kind of kicked off. It's been about four years since the pandemic and people are in that refresh cycle where they're going to go out and buy new products.
We'll be seeing that as PC sales start to pull back up. There's been different reports from Gartner and IDC essentially saying the same thing that the slowdown is starting to come to an end, and we'll see a return to growth in 2024. So that should really benefit Apple and its Mac and iPad business.
Story continues
We're also-- there's been rumblings about new iPads coming, and the Mac line has been refreshed with Apple's M3 chips. And so these are the kind of boons that they're looking for. This-- they're going to potentially see this kind of reinvigoration of those segments and oh, yeah, they're running with really new processors.
And so that's something that I think a lot of people are going to be interested in. The flip side of that is, you know, Apple's computers tend to last a long time and so people don't necessarily need to upgrade them as often as they may other PC makers, so that could be a problem for them. But
This is going to be, I think, a year where Apple starts to regain that strength in the Mac and the iPad business.
RACHELLE AKUFFO:
 And it's interesting. When you consider the slump that we saw in PC sales and as you mentioned, IDC predicting global PC shipments forecast to recover in 2024, you don't usually think of-- I mean, obviously a lot of people still use Apple's laptops, but how do you see them gaining market share from that?
Is it just about perhaps people getting that refresh as you mentioned that even though price is still relatively high versus say getting a Microsoft PC?
DAN HOWLEY:
 Yeah, the prices are very high compared to getting a Windows PC although, you know, all things being equal between the capabilities of one and the capabilities of the other, the prices are relatively equal. They just don't sell the entry level devices that you would get from a Windows PC.
But we were talking-- you mentioned earlier the Vision Pro headset, and, you know, I think the question is, where is that going to fit in Apple's business segments, right? Is that going to be part of the computer segment? They do call it a spatial computer, not a headset. They refuse to call it a headset.
So will it be part of the Mac segment? Will it be part of the wearables segment? It could give a boon to the Mac segment if it slots in there because it is a computer. Likely, it'll be in the wearables because you're going to wear it on your face, and, you know, I think for Apple at first, it's not going to be a volume seller that's basically just known now. $3,500 is going to be expensive.
So I think when it does hit, it's going to make a splash. It's not going to be in a lot of people's houses, though.
RACHELLE AKUFFO:
 True that it does seem to be more so for the early adopter who's going to take this on, but I mean, you never know. I mean, that price tag though. But I mean, yeah. I mean, you never know. I might be open to it. I might. Dan Howley, always great to get your take on all things tech. Thank you so much."

Barclays analyst Tim Long downgraded the stock from Equal-Weight to Underweight and lowered the price target from $161 to $160.
The analyst slightly lowered his AAPL estimates following another round of checks. He still picks up weakness in iPhone volumes and mix and a lack of bounce-back in Macs, iPads, and wearables.
Apple is now reportedly expected to launch its futuristic $3,500 Vision Pro headset in the last week of January, accelerating the 
launch timeline from February
.
With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends too. As of now, the Cupertino, California-based company offers an annual dividend yield of 0.52%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 24 cents per share (96 cents a year).
So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?
To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,160,250 or around 6,250 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $232,050 or around 1,250 shares.
Read This:

To Calculate: 
 Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.68 in this case). So, $6,000 / $0.96 = 6,250 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $0.96 = 1,250 shares ($100 per month).
Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.
How that works: 
 The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock's current price.
For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).
Story continues
Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.
AAPL Price Action:
 Shares of Apple fell 3.6% to close at $185.64 on Tuesday.

SEANA SMITH:
 Josh, let's get back to the conversation we were having in terms of the leaders to the downside or the underperformers, I should say, when it comes to tech, obviously massive decliner. Yesterday, some new notes out on the street in terms of maybe what those future declines could potentially look like.
JOSH SCHAFER:
 Yeah, so Bank of America pointing out, they called it a street consensus and the street consensus being broadening out, so not necessarily-- and that's the understanding of the call here, I think, in general for '24. There aren't a lot of people saying don't own tech stocks and don't own the Mag Seven, they're saying maybe there's opportunity elsewhere and at some point, that means money has to come from somewhere, right?
And so if you're going to invest in those other 493 stocks, maybe you sell the stock that was up 250% last year, or at least take some profits from it. I mean, you look at that Mag Seven chart from last year that we love to show, there's some impressive gains in there. And so if anyone is profiting-- if anyone is profit taking in there, it might make a little bit of sense.
But Bank of America actually did make sense of how they think that call, at least for January, might not be fully correct, and I found that sort of interesting. They're pointing out something like a passive index fund actually bases their inflows on market capitalization. So if they're just sort of running a traditional model. I can see Myles' spinning.
Story continues
But they are high mark-- they are high market caps, right? So at some point, some of the money could just naturally flow into their-- basically on the model and not necessarily because it's the play.
MYLES UDLAND:
 Yeah. I mean, I think-- and, you know, Josh, you and I spent a lot of time, over the last month, thinking about the consensus call for 2024, but really we just talked about what the consensus call for 2023 was, right? And that call was there would be a recession in the first half of the year, stocks would go down and the stocks would go back to flat for the year, which didn't happen at all.
Stocks ripped out of the gate, and we were off to the races. What's notable about 2024's consensus, and I think we're really seeing it in the last couple of days, the way people are discussing the move in tech, which is it's fine, right? We actually do need to catch up with all these other names because we saw again, you go back to that Magnificent Seven chart.
Meta is up 160% last year, NVIDIA triples I think. I mean, these companies are adding hundreds of billions, in Apple's case, nearly $1 trillion in market cap, to the biggest companies in the market. So everyone is saying, well, you got to do something else. You should buy like something smaller, or-- I mean, you could just pick a company that's got $100 billion market cap instead of $3 trillion, right, and it counts as small.
But I am very curious to see, you mentioned the flows part of it, how that manifests itself, because if there's one thing and, you know, you think about Mike Hartnett over at BofA, if there's one thing he loves more than anything, it's like, oh, well, everyone says this, so it's definitely going to be the opposite and for sure, the consensus trade is buy anything that doesn't have magnificent in front of it.
JOSH SCHAFER:
 Right. Yeah. And so you wonder maybe you just buy more magnificent, right? You're saying the opposite plays up?
MYLES UDLAND:
 Well, I-- I didn't-- I didn't mean to twist myself into that--
SEANA SMITH:
 Anyone's guessing--
MYLES UDLAND:
 I didn't mean to big brain it that much, but I guess we kind of got there in the end, right?
JOSH SCHAFER:
 Yeah. Yeah. I thought it was interesting just looking at the charts overall too. We didn't-- you mentioned it earlier, thinking about that cap weighted S&P 500 though, right? And like, really the trade that we've seen just kind of played out a little bit more to start the year in some ways, depending on what area of the market you were looking at.
But that cap weighted index has outperformed the normal S&P 500 for over a month and a half now.
MYLES UDLAND:
 Well--
JOSH SCHAFER:
 And that's what people were calling for, right? Isn't that the healthy rally we wanted? Didn't we want this?
MYLES UDLAND:
 The interesting part about the '24 consensus is that it actually happened between Thanksgiving and Christmas and now that's over. So we got '24 at the end of '23. We got to figure out something different over the next couple of months.
SEANA SMITH:
 We'll see, guys. It's only been one full trading day. You can't call it yet.
MYLES UDLAND:
 I just did. We just did. It's over.
JOSH SCHAFER:
 Year '25 price targets, here we come.
MYLES UDLAND:
 --over. Just like the day ends when the market opens, the year is over the second day the market opens. So--
SEANA SMITH:
 You heard it here first.
MYLES UDLAND:
 --happy new year 2025.
SEANA SMITH:
 All right. All right. Josh, thanks so much for that uplifting convo here."

The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 6% to 13.20. A total of 11.9 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 12.4 billion.
Apple (AAPL) Weighs Down on the Tech Sector
Shares of Apple Inc. AAPL declined 3.6% after Barclays downgraded the tech behemoth’s rating to “underweight”. The analysts cited weakening demand for the company’s flagship mobile iPhone 15 and almost zero upgrades to the iPhone 16 model as the main reason. Demand has been a major concern for the company since early 2023, and its holiday season sales forecast has also been below Wall Street estimates. Apple has also struggled in China’s market since the resurgence of Huawei. Being one of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks, Apple’s plight weighed down on the tech sector and the broader market in general.
Consequently, shares of Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD fell 1.4% and 6%, respectively. Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see

On Tuesday, the U.S. benchmark 10-year treasury yield climbed above the 4% mark to touch a 2-week high before settling at 3.937%. When treasury yields go up, future valuations of mega-cap growth stocks like tech seem unreasonable, and it weighs on the sector.

 (Reuters / Reuters)
Apple (
AAPL
)
Shares in Apple were lower in extended trading after 
Barclays downgraded the iPhone maker
 and lowered its price target for shares of the company on fears of slowing iPhone 15 sales in China.
“We are still picking up weakness on iPhone volumes and mix, as well as a lack of bounce-back in Macs, iPads and wearables,” Barclays analyst Tim Long wrote in a note Tuesday.
“The biggest takeaway from the latest checks is incrementally worse [iPhone 15] data points out of China, together with developed markets remaining soft,” he added.

Shares fell 3.6% on Tuesday, their biggest one-day percentage drop since September, and the decline erased more than $107bn (£84.79bn) in market value.
Rivian (
RIVN
)
Rivian shares slipped in extended trading after the electric-vehicle startup reported fourth-quarter and full-year delivery and production numbers.
Rivian reported Tuesday it had delivered 13,972 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2023, falling a hair short of the 14,000 forecasted by analysts.
Shares plunged 10% in regular trading but brokerage firm Baird still calls the stock the “best idea” for 2024, with a price target of $30.
While an earlier-than-expected bond issuance in October had sent Rivian's stock plunging on fears over its financial health, the company is widely seen as better placed among the EV startups.
Moderna (
MRNA
)
Moderna shares were trending higher in extended trading after 
Oppenheimer upgraded the stock
 to 'Outperform' and raised its price target to $142 per share, implying a more than 40% gain from Friday's closing price.
Oppenheimer analyst Hartaj Singh said the company’s COVID sales could hit a low point in 2024 due to factors such as vaccine fatigue. But the firm expects COVID vaccine sales to rise in 2025 and beyond as education about COVID and spending on awareness about the disease increase.
Singh told 
Yahoo Finance
 he was even more upbeat about Moderna’s pipeline potential, highlighting a handful of possible product launches over the next 12 to 18 months that could boost sales in 2025.
Story continues
Shares of the company slumped nearly 45% in 2023, marking their worst annual performance to date, weighed down by weak sales of its COVID-19 vaccine.
GSK (
GSK.L
)
In London, GSK surged almost by 2% as Jefferies took a more positive view of the pharmaceuticals company.
Jefferies analysts said in a research note that GSK is expected to guide for at least low single-digit EPS growth for 2024 and settle the Zantac litigation case within the coming months.

Jefferies raises its target price on the stock to 1,900 pence from 1,550 pence.
In terms of valuation, GSK is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 9.63, a discount from the industry’s average of 22.86.

 Tesla’s fourth-quarter delivery and production numbers were good, but Wall Street doesn’t sit still. The focus has already moved on to 2024 profit margins and shipments. The electric-vehicle company delivered a better-than-expected 485,000 cars and trucks in the final three months of the year. 
 Tesla
 shares fell six cents to $248.42, but that was a tremendous result considering the 
 Nasdaq Composite
 dropped 1.6%. 
 Apple
 shares fell 3.6% following a downgrade from Barclays, and stock in 
 Rivian Automotive
 stock plunged 10% to $21.10 after the company reported its own solid delivery figures.   In 2023, “Rivian fixed production, began its journey to scale in earnest, and started to beat/raise its guidance targets,” wrote Canaccord analyst George Gianarikas in a Tuesday report. “It ended the year with a bang, exceeding its production target by about 3,000. Deliveries were also in line with consensus and higher than our estimates, leaving us mildly confused by [the] stock reaction.” Investors just weren’t in the mood to buy shares to start the new year. A second headwind is that Rivian shares were up about 30% in the month coming into the delivery report. Gianarikas rates Rivian stock at Buy and has a target of $30 for the price. He also rates Tesla shares at Buy, with a $267 price target. He was impressed by Tesla’s delivery performance too, noting that the company shipped more than 1.8 million vehicles in 2023, as it had told investors to expect, despite rising interest rates and a slowing economy. Still, Gianarikas said he is “riddled with more questions than answers.” At the top of the list is whether 2024 expectations for deliveries of about 2.2 million units are low enough. Then there is whether automotive gross margins have hit bottom at about 16% in the third quarter, down about 10 percentage points from a year earlier, as a result of Tesla’s price cuts. And given that Tesla isn’t expected to launch a new vehicle model in 2024, can investors get excited about Optimus the robot, and advancements in Tesla’s driver assistance software? “More important than today’s delivery news is a crucial earnings call thatawaits,” he added. That call is slated for Jan. 24. TD Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne believes Tesla needs to forecast deliveries of about 2.2 million vehicles on the January call to keep investors happy. He rates Tesla shares Hold and has a $200 price target for the stock. New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu rates shares Buy and has a $300 price target. He wrote after the delivery report that gross profit margins should remain “under pressure” in the fourth quarter, but sees them improving to about 19% in 2024. Overall, Wall Street is a bit less upbeat. It expects the fourth-quarter gross profit margin, excluding regulatory credits, to come in at about 16%, similar to the third quarter, and improve by about one or two percentage points in 2024. The earnings conference call is the next big deal for the stock. Comments CEO Elon Musk makes about further price cuts and interest rates will go a long way to answering some of the lingering questions Wall Street has after a record quarter for shipments. Tesla stock was down 2.9% in early trading Wednesday, while the 
 S&P 500
 and 
 Nasdaq Composite
 had both fallen 0.5%. Write to Al Root at allen.root@dowjones.com

 (REUTERS / Reuters)
FTSE and European markets finished in the red this Wednesday, making the London's benchmark 40th anniversary a bittersweet celebration.
The FTSE 100 (
^FTSE
) lost 0.6% to close at 7,677 points during afternoon trading, while the CAC 40 (
^FCHI
) in Paris fell 1.8% to 7,397 points. In Germany, the DAX (
^GDAXI
) retreated 1.5% to 16,512. Europe’s Stoxx 600 (
^STOXX
) was down by 1%.
The FTSE 100 celebrated its 40th anniversary, as firms from Barclays (
BARC.L
) to Sainsbury’s (
SBRY.L
) remain a fixture of the UK’s top stock market index.
Dubbed the Footsie, the index containing the biggest 100 companies on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) launched on January 3 1984.

Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell, said: “The headline index has made almost no progress since the start of the century, and in the last decade the Footsie has been totally eclipsed by the US stock market, which is winning company listings and financial flows.
“Since 2016, domestic investors have been relentlessly selling UK equity funds in favour of more global offerings, no doubt driven in part by better performance from overseas equities.”
On Wall Street, 
US stocks slid
 as bond yields rose, as optimism for fast interest-rate cuts waned ahead of fresh jobs data and the release of Federal Reserve meeting minutes.
The Dow Jones (
^DJI
) lost 0.6% to 37,472 points. The S&P 500 (
^GSPC
) slipped 0.6% to 4,712 points. The tech-heavy NASDAQ (
^IXIC
) retreated 0.8% to 14,647.
This evening, the US Federal Reserve will issue minutes of December’s interest rate meeting, which brokers expect will give investors more clarity on the path of interest rates this year.
In Asia, the Hang Seng (
^HSI
) in Hong Kong slipped 1% to 16,628 points, while the Shanghai Composite (

 It’s been a busy start to the year on Wall Street with a deluge of stock upgrades and downgrades. The street-note stampede is shaping the early 2024 action for a number of stocks—most notably 
 Apple
 and 
 Moderna.  Verizon Communications
 is another stock seemingly enjoying a new-year boost gift-wrapped by Wall Street.  KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded shares of the telecom firm to Overweight from Sector Weight, and said the company faced a favorable wireless industry setup in 2024, in a note Tuesday. The stock jumped 3.1% Tuesday, and was 1.8% higher early Wednesday. Their price target is $45, implying 16% upside to Tuesday’s closing price. KeyBanc’s note is titled ‘New Year, New 
 Verizon
 ’ and that certainly seems to be accurate for the shares so far this year. The stock fell 4% in 2023, and is on track to recoup all of that on the second trading day of 2024. Shifting fortunes is an early theme of the year, if that’s even possible just one day in. 
 Moderna
 and 
 Apple
 were two clear examples. Moderna shares, the worst performing in the 
 S&P 500
 in 2023, surged 13% on Jan. 2 following an upgrade from Oppenheimer.                            
 Newsletter Sign-up           
 Apple stock, up nearly 50% last year, fell 3.6% on Jan. 2 to a seven-week low after Barclays downgraded the shares to Underweight from Equal Weight.  In keeping with that, KeyBanc analysts expect 2024 to be one of the best in recent history for Verizon. Analysts led by Brandon Nispel said they expected Verizon’s growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to rise to above 2% in 2024, from flat last year—its second-fastest growth rate since 2018. They also noted that it currently trades at historically low levels—with a forward enterprise value-to-Ebitda ratio of 6.25 times compared with its three-year average of 6.9 times. The analysts also expect postpaid-phone subscriber growth to continue at above average pace for the industry, with capital expenditure also coming down. The lack of competitive intensity in the sector was another reason behind the upgrade. “Wireless carriers appear complacent with their performance, and no one wants to ‘rock the boat,’ which makes us want more wireless exposure,” they added. 
 T-Mobile US
 stock was also pointing higher early Wednesday, up 0.3% in premarket trading, while shares of 
 AT&T
 edged 0.1% higher. Write to Callum Keown at callum.keown@barrons.com

Steve Eisman, of “Big Short” fame and now portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman, told CNBC that he’s worried “everybody is coming into the year feeling too good.” Note, technology is one area the manager favors for 2024, with some Wall Street banks also hoping for more of what they saw in 2023.   That may partly explain why Apple and tech stocks got hit so hard by the Barclays’ advice to sell the stock on Tuesday. We stay on the tech sector in our call of the day from a D.A. Davidson analyst, an early fan of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) who is now warning the software sector is “approaching the trough of disillusionment” over the technology. Gil Luria, senior software analyst, said he hasn’t changed his year-ago view that GenAI would be the “most important transformative technology since the internet,” but notes how companies now regularly trot out related products and strategies. “We expect the market to do what the market does and compete the gains away from all but a few. We may be experiencing the most FOMO [fear of missing out] shortened cycle to date,” Luria told clients in a note. Chats with industry participants have revealed “significant obstacles” for enterprise customers in implementing GenAI solutions, as they first need to modernize existing data, and even set up AI committees to deal with cybersecurity impacts and other issues. That means more time will be needed to ramp up those solutions, he said. The analyst expects just a few companies will be able to point to direct GenAI revenue benefits — Nvidia 
 NVDA,
 -1.60%,
 Microsoft 
 MSFT,
 -0.04%
 and “generously” Adobe 
 ADBE,
 -3.70%.
 “We expect this number to expand this year as a few more companies crack the code and find a new GenAI killer app, but believe it unlikely they all do.” He sees Amazon 
 AMZN,
 -0.68%
 and Google 
 GOOGL,
 +0.29%,
 via their cloud platforms, along with Snowflake 
 SNOW,
 -0.89%,
 leveraging investments in GenAI infrastructure “to allow everybody else to play with their own products.” But as for Nvidia, in a separate note he assumed coverage on the company with a neutral rating and $410 price target, as he warned the AI chip giant is vulnerable to that coming “trough of disillusionment.” Luria explains many Nvidia’s customers will fill their GenAI capacity over this year, a shift that will start to fade in 2025. Included in his price target is $155 per share for “sandbox” revenue coming in from GenAI. “We believe the value of this sandbox could drop considerably once NVDA growth rolls over.” He’s got a more upbeat view on Amazon, where he assumed coverage with a buy rating and a $195 per share target, up from a previous $157. “We believe a potential reacceleration of growth in AWS [Amazon Web Services] could drive upside to shares in 2024, as AMZN gets some of the GenAI boost already in MSFT [buy-rated at D.A. Davidson], GOOGL and META 
 META,
 -1.02%
 shares,” he said. Finally, Luria discussed Apple in a separate note, assuming coverage with a neutral rating and $166 per share price target, both the same as previously. Apple will likely return to “moderate growth” this year, boosted by services and easier comparisons on Mac sales, but needs to get “unstuck” on innovation to help generate product growth, as wearables seem to have plateaued, he said. Like Barclays, Luria also sees iPhone domination challenges. “While Apple may have a strong hold on existing handset owners because of the strength of its ecosystem, it will need to be more creative in order to convert new consumers to the iOS ecosystem,” notably in places like China. GenAI applications could prompt some of that new innovation, with Apple “in a position to leverage an unparalleled walled garden consumer data set to provide new applications and experiences,” said Luria.The markets U.S. stocks

 Stocks declined Wednesday for a second-straight session as investors tempered their optimism about interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in 2024. These stocks made moves Wednesday:  
 Apple
  extended losses, falling 0.8% to $184.25, after the iPhone maker closed down 3.6% Tuesday following a downgrade to Underweight from Equal Weight by analysts at Barclays, who noted weakness in sales of iPhones and Mac computers. Apple’s growth has stalled, Barron’s has noted previously, despite the stock’s gain last year of 48%.  
 SoFi Technologies
 was downgraded to Underperform from Market Perform at Keefe Bruyette and the price target on shares of the financial-technology company were reduced to $6.50 from $7.50. The stock fell 14% to $8.31. Keefe Bruyette also downgraded 
 Rocket Cos.,
 the parent of home loan originator Rocket Mortgage, to Underperform from Market Perform and left the price target at $10.75. 
 Wells Fargo,
 meanwhile, downgraded Rocket to Equal Weight from Overweight but raised its price target to $14 from $13. Rocket shares fell 6.6% to $13.34. 
 Tesla
 was down 4%, closing lower for a fourth-straight day. 
 Tesla
 reported fourth-quarter deliveries that beat analysts’ estimates but was topped in the period by China’s 
 BYD,
 which posted deliveries of 526,000 all-electric vehicles, making the company the world’s largest seller of all-battery electric vehicles. 
 Enphase Energy
 was one of the leading decliners in the 
 S&P 500
 on Wednesday, falling 6.6% to $122.63. Analysts at Mizuho maintained their Buy rating on shares of the solar and alternative-energy products company and raised their price target to $150 from $131. 
 Xerox
 dropped 12% after the copier and printer maker said it was targeting a 15% workforce reduction this quarter as part of a new operating model it unveiled. 
 AST SpaceMobile,
 which is building a space-based cellular broadband network, was up 1.7% after disclosing that it was seeking to close and fund a previously disclosed strategic investment this month with multiple parties. The company also said it had secured initial ground infrastructure orders from two customers. 
 Verizon Communications
 was upgraded by KeyBanc to Overweight from Sector Weight with a price target of $45. The analysts said they expect “wireless industry competitive intensity being low, which makes us want more wireless exposure,” and that the company should show “better postpaid phone net add performance” in 2024. Verizon rose 0.7% to $39.16. 
 PGT Innovations
 received an unsolicited proposal from Miter Brands to acquire all outstanding shares of the windows and doors company for $41.50 a share in cash. The offer implies an equity value of about $2.37 billion. 
 PGT
 had reached a deal last month to be bought by 
 Masonite International
 for $33.50 in cash and $7.50 in stock. PGT said that it would review the Miter Brands’ proposal to determine if it was reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal. Shares of 
 PGT Innovations
 were up 3.7% to $41.70. Write to Joe Woelfel at joseph.woelfel@barrons.com

AAPL
) fell 3.6% at the close of trading in New York on Tuesday, the stock's steepest drop since August. The moves came after Barclays downgraded the iPhone maker and lowered its price target for shares of the company on fears of slowing iPhone 15 sales in China.
“We are still picking up weakness on iPhone volumes and mix, as well as a lack of bounce-back in Macs, iPads and wearables,” Barclays analyst Tim Long wrote in a note Tuesday.
“The biggest takeaway from the latest checks is incrementally worse [iPhone 15] data points out of China, together with developed markets remaining soft,” he added.
According to Long, the softness in iPhone sales is likely to continue even after Apple launches the iPhone 16 later this year, as the phone isn’t expected to have many major upgrades over the current model.
Apple’s iPhone revenue declined roughly $5 billion in 2023 versus 2022. Sales of the company’s Macs, iPads, and wearables were also off, as consumers felt pressure from rising inflation and interest rates. The PC industry was also stung as fewer consumers needed to purchase new systems after millions bought up laptops and desktops at the start of the pandemic.
Long also called out Apple’s services business as a potential weak link for the company, saying that the segment faces a number of battles ahead including those related to its App Store practices. Apple is facing pressure to allow app developers to offer users a means of paying for apps via third-party payment options that would cut out Apple’s 30% App Store fee.

The company’s deal to use Google as the default search engine in its Safari browser could also be under threat as the Department of Justice continues its antitrust case against the search giant. Apple is estimated to rake in billions on the deal, which is reported under the services business.
Apple’s service business, on the other hand, jumped from $78.1 billion in 2022 to $85.2 billion in 2023. Long, however, says that the segment will start to see growth slow in the coming years.
Story continues
“We model ~10% and ~8% growth in services in FY24 and FY25, well below [the] prior growth estimate of ~20%. In 2024, we should get an initial determination on the Google TAC, and some app store investigations could intensify,” Long wrote.

At the same time, Apple is continuing to fight its patent battle with medical device maker Masimo over whether the Apple Watch’s blood oxygen sensor infringes on Masimo’s patents related to the technology.
Apple initially pulled its Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 from store shelves ahead of Christmas after the International Trade Commission called for a ban on imports of the watches. But a federal appeals court ruled Apple could continue selling the watches while the dispute works its way through the court system.
Despite those potential troubles, Apple has a major bright spot on the horizon: its Vision Pro headset. Apple is expected to host a launch event for the AR/VR headset sometime in February. And if the Vision Pro, which Apple refers to as a spatial computer, is a success, it could set up Apple as the go-to company for a new generation of computing devices.

 You mentioned Apple, so let's stick with that one because that was certainly a weight on the stock market today. Sliding after Barclays downgrades that stock to underweight, lowers its price target by $1. Barclays citing a weakness in iPhone volumes and mix, while other hardware categories expected to remain weak.
So this is a big one, Julie, because you don't often see an analyst downgrade Apple to the equivalent of a sell. But Barclays did. They go to underweight. Time for a breather, they say. The target, 160. Bottom line, they say iPhone 15 sales are lackluster, their words according to their own checks. The next iPhone, the 16, which you would expect in September, they think will be more of the same. And as for Macs, iPads, wearables, they see a lack of a bounce back there.
-
 Interestingly, they pinpoint China in particular as one of the areas of weakness here. The biggest takeaway from the latest check says the note is incrementally worse. IPhone 15 data points out of China together with developed markets remaining soft, which was quite interesting.
Here's a little bit of anecdata. Love the anecdata. I just got a new phone, full disclosure. A new iPhone. I got the iPhone 15. I went in planning to get the 14. I got it from a Verizon store. I'm very transparent here.
Story continues
-
 Yeah.
-
 And they said, if you turn in-- first of all, they had no stock of the 14, which tells me that there's more demand for the 14 right now than for the 15. Secondly, they gave me a deal on the 15. There was no such deal on the 14. So it seems like there are some incentives here to try to push out more 15. That was my very anecdotal reading between the lines.
-
 Yeah. Barclays could have surveyed Julie Hyman and just written the note off that. It's interesting because when you think about Apple, listen, it had a very strong 2023. The key question for investors is now how do they get this top line going after quarters in a row of declining sales? And when it comes to the US and China in particular, what is iPhone demand going to look like in the quarters ahead?
-
 Yeah. I have to mention, circling back to the discussion we had at the top of the show. The average price target for Apple according to Bloomberg data, $199.50 for the end of this year, which implies only about 3.5% upside. That's after the 48% gain that the stock saw last year.
So all of those Magnificent Seven are expected to have more muted gains. But I think besides Tesla, yep, that's the lowest number that we're expecting, at least analysts are expecting. That doesn't mean they're right, but it just tells you something about the expectations game.
Let's talk about Chevron as well, watching that stock. It's warning it's facing billions in charges for the fourth quarter. The company citing regulatory challenges and environmental liabilities. Now this hasn't particular to do with what's going on in California. The company says it's going to write down the value of $3.5 to $4 billion worth of assets.
And it's kind of a political story here. The shares are not affected that much. But basically, it says the California is overegulating the company. It says California regulations have resulted in lower anticipated future investment levels. By the way, Chevron is headquartered in California here. And the company says production in California has dropped 15% since the pandemic and now is only 3% of its output globally here. So basically, California regulatory does not have a very friendly stance towards fossil fuels, and so that's kind of what's at the heart of this issue.
-
 Yeah. And Bloomberg has a good write up too, just looking at the relationship between Chevron and the state of California, my home state. Noting it has been, I think we can call it, let's call it rocky. The state sued Chevron, said the company has kind of lied about climate change. Then Chevron shot back, disputed that of course, but did cut back on refinery investments, talked about a difficult business environment there. It hasn't been easygoing for Chevron. If you've been long that name, stock's down more than 10% in the past 12 months. Though most financial analysts, they do cover Chevron. They argue it's a buy here.
-
 And one more interesting thing here, it's not just California, by the way. There are old installations in the Gulf of Mexico that are now going offline. Even if Chevron doesn't own them anymore because of US law, not California law, because of US regulations, it still has to participate in the cost of cleanup for those now closed installations, which is interesting.
-
 It is interesting though because as you mentioned to begin with, the stock actually finished higher today. And I don't know if that's just because--
-
 Maybe not a surprise.
-
 Maybe not a surprise. Or it's good news, let's get it behind us. Or maybe they thought the number was going to be bigger. It was interesting reaction. Finally, shares of Citigroup getting a lift, as well as Fargo analyst Mike Mayo predicts Citi stock will more than double over the next three years. This comes as Wells Fargo named Citigroup its top pick for big banks in 2024.
So when Mike Mayo speaks, Julie Hyman, we know Mike, investors pay attention. Named Citi as top pick among the big banks at least for this year. Thinks shares can double over the next three years. His base case, it looks like, the stock rises to about 119 through 2026. So many investors don't want to hear about Citigroup, Mike was saying. But to Mike, that's actually this kind of bullish indicator. He likes that negative sentiment and says, OK, that actually-- I like that. It means probably a more favorable setup.
-
 Mike Mayo, both a well-known bank analyst and a well-known contrarian, right? So it's not surprising that he says the sentiment here is very bad. So I want to get in. JP Morgan had long been his favorite stock. He's talked up JP Morgan for a long time. Now Citi is his top pick for this year, as you mentioned. It replaces JP Morgan, which I thought was interesting.
All of this has to do with what Jane Fraser has been doing at Citigroup, which is a very involved restructuring that we have been talking about for months now, where it's involved moving around departments, cutting jobs as well. He says it's going to be simpler and more profitable as a result of the work that she is doing.
-
 Yeah. Equity analysts still actually kind of divided on this. 11, like Mike, say it's a buy here, but 17 are on the sidelines. As you noted though, Mike probably likes that.
-
 Yes.
-
 Exactly what he wants to hear."

 in the US hasn’t budged from the hourly rate of $7.25 in over 
14 years
. But 22 states and 40 cities increased their own minimum wages to ring in the New Year.
As of Jan. 1, 
seven states
 (along with the District of Columbia) now have minimum wages of at least $15: Washington, Connecticut, Massachusetts,
 
California, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland.
An additional six states have approved gradual increases to $15 an hour. Oregon, where the minimum wage is currently $14.20, 
adjusts
 its rate for inflation every year on July 1.
Voters are 
increasingly approving
 ballot measures to raise the minimum wage in their own states.
Thanks to a 
voter referendum
 in November 2020, Florida’s $12 minimum wage will increase to $13 on Sept. 30 and will rise by $1 on the same date each year until 2026, when it reaches $15 an hour. Hawaii’s minimum wage schedule is similar, 
reaching
 $16 an hour in 2026 and $18 an hour effective in 2028.
Later this year, voters in Ohio, Oklahoma, and Michigan may decide on $15 hourly wage proposals in their statewide elections.
Meanwhile, California enacted industry-specific hourly wages in 2023: 
Fast food workers
 now earn a minimum wage of $20 an hour starting in April, while 
healthcare workers
 will make at least $25 an hour by 2026.
At the same time, 20 states are still at the standard $7.25 minimum wage rate — including Pennsylvania.
""It is quite an embarrassment for Pennsylvania to be the only state — we're an island among all the other states who surround us who over the past several years, each and every year, have increased their minimum wages,"" 
said
 the state’s Senate Democratic leader, Jay Costa.

Some major cities also have their own minimum wages separate from federal and state levels. 
New York City
 — along with nearby Long Island and Westchester County — has a $16 minimum wage, while 
Oregon’s Portland metro area
 is $15.45.
And as of Jan. 1, dozens more cities and counties 
are seeing
 a rise in minimum wage, a majority of these cities located in California. Cupertino, the home base of Apple (
AAPL
), is raising its minimum wage by $0.55 to $17.75 an hour. San Diego’s new hourly minimum wage will be $16.85, while Sunnyvale’s will come in at $18.55.
Story continues
Outside of California, Denver’s new minimum wage will be $18.29 an hour, while Minneapolis’s will now be $15.57, both due to inflation adjustments. Boulder County’s increase is the highest among all cities and counties, with a $2.04 pay bump to $15.69 an hour.
Finally, three cities in Washington — SeaTac, Seattle, and Tukwila — are all bumping their hourly pay as a result of inflation. Tukwila’s new minimum wage is the highest among the three at $20.29.

Apple slid nearly 3.6% to a seven-week low on Tuesday after Barclays downgraded the stock to underweight from equal weight, while also trimming the stock’s price target to $160 from $161. Tuesday's losses wiped out about $100 billion of market capitalization from the iPhone maker.
Barclays analysts flagged increased headwinds for Apple’s future device sales, particularly the iPhone. Such a scenario bodes poorly for Asian suppliers, given that a bulk of Apple’s supply chain for its devices is geared heavily towards Asia.
Shares of South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930)- which supply memory chips and displays to Apple- sank between 2% and 3%. Samsung SDI (KS:006400)- which supplies Apple with batteries- shed 2.9%.
LG Display (KS:034220) and LG Chem Ltd (KS:051915)- which are also suppliers to the iPhone maker- shed 0.3% and 2.5%, respectively, while Posco International Corp (KS:047050) lost 0.8%.
Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW:2317) and TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM)- which are key semiconductor suppliers to Apple- lost 0.5% and 2% in Taiwan trade.
In China, AAC Technologies Holdings Inc (HK:2018)- which supplies acoustic components to Apple- fell 3.6%, while BYD (HK:1211) sank 0.4% in Hong Kong trade.
Barclays said that after a lackluster sales performance by the iPhone 15, its successor was likely to follow suit, with the firm unlikely to incorporate any new technologies that could spur a substantial sales boost.
Apple’s sales in China declined for three quarters in 2023, with the decline being partially attributed to a ban on government employees from using Apple products. The firm is also facing increased competition in the country from new offerings from Huawei, which had in October launched a new flagship phone aimed directly at the iPhone.
Story continues
Barclays said that Apple is likely to see weaker sales in developed markets, while increased sales in emerging markets are unlikely to offset the decline. The firm's services unit is also expected to see laggard revenue growth in the coming year.

JOSH LIPTON:
 So let's stick with the Magnificent Seven here because we know they drove record market gains in 2023. And Wall Street, optimistic the tech giants can keep that momentum going in the new year. According to estimates compiled by FactSet, the Street is projecting the Magnificent Seven stocks will rise an average of 11% in the new year, with the exception of laggard Tesla.
So as you mentioned, Julia, this is sort of that time of year, you rethink your portfolio maybe a bit. You think you know what, do I stick with the winners, right? And certainly the Magnificent Seven winners in 2023. If you piled in 12 months ago, you're probably feeling pretty good and pretty smart right about now. And there were different reasons those stocks worked last year.
You could think about AI, certainly these were companies that put so much time and effort and money into that tech, and they began to integrate that tech across their product portfolios.
Another reason obviously, some investors piled in because they thought they were defensive, right? They saw they were relatively predictable strong moats, strong balance sheets. Warren Buffett likes some of them. He's a pretty smart guy. So now the question is, do you think do you stick with that trade as we head into the new year?
JULIE HYMAN:
 Well, most strategists are sticking with that trade, at least the individual analysts who cover these stocks, if we look at those price targets, except for Tesla, they're all on average looking for upside here. That said, they're all expecting less upside than we saw last year without exception. All of those Magnificent Seven stocks, if you calculate the change from the close on Friday, last Friday, to the price target, we're talking about a smaller gain than they saw in 2023, or in Tesla's case, a loss.
Story continues
So it is optimism, but it's more muted optimism going into this year. One of the folks who's a macro person, who looks at this is David Costner over at Goldman Sachs. He says the baseline is that mega-cap tech stocks will continue to outperform the remainder of the S&P 500, although it should be said, the forecast for the S&P overall, there's a big range, but most of them are also for modest gains in the index.
JOSH LIPTON:
 There are some, you know, dedicated tech bulls, though, who are you people are being too conservative. And I think it comes down to where the AI. And they see these companies-- and this is the very bullish case. They see these companies continuing to invest. They're going to keep integrating that tech across their products, across their services, and they just are making a bet that use cases and monetization is going to keep ramping.
JULIE HYMAN:
 Yeah. A couple of individual things that I just quickly want to mention that's going on today. One of them is that Apple shares are trading lower. They got an a rating over from Barclays that is pushing the shares down.
JOSH LIPTON:
 Very rare downgrade to sell--
JULIE HYMAN:
 Yes, exactly.
JOSH LIPTON:
 --the iPhone. But you don't see that very often.
JULIE HYMAN:
 Time for a breather, they say. So we're going to talk more about this later, but you could argue given the size of Apple as Apple goes--
JOSH LIPTON:
 For sure.
JULIE HYMAN:
 --the rest of tech, and then the rest of the market goes. So that's definitely weighing on things today. On the flip side, you've got Tesla, which is out with deliveries, we're going to talk more about that later as well. And so even though the forecast is for it to decline on the year, it had been higher earlier today.
JOSH LIPTON:
 Because they beat. They beat consensus.
JULIE HYMAN:
 Now off by 2/3.
JOSH LIPTON:
 Yeah.
JULIE HYMAN:
 We'll keep watching that one."

Apple
 stock down 3.65% on Tuesday, shaving over $100 billion from the tech giant’s market cap.
Barclays
 analyst Tim Long tagged Apple with an “underweight” rating due to weak iPhone demand Tuesday morning, arguing its shares could sink roughly 13% to $160 over the next 12 months.
It’s rare to see any analyst hit America’s highest-valued company with a negative rating. Apple is rated at hold or better by 40 out of 44 Wall Street forecasters, according to 
data
 provided to the 
Wall Street Journal 
by FactSet. But Long said that iPhone 15 sales have been “lackluster”—particularly in China, which has reportedly 
banned
 government officials from using Apple’s flagship product due to security concerns. He also expects sales of the iPhone 16, which is set to be released in September, to be weaker than expected. “We see no features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling,” he wrote.
While Barclays’ downgrade may have sparked Apple’s stock price drop Tuesday, there are several other factors putting the company under pressure. For one, after Apple shares jumped nearly 50% last year, investors might be reallocating some capital away from the company in the new year. “The new year brings tax-motivated postponed gain-taking and repositioning by portfolio managers,” Louis Navellier, founder and chairman of Navellier & Associates, 
told Bloomberg
 Tuesday.
Apple’s decline also coincides with wider weakness in the tech-heavy 
Nasdaq
 Composite. The index sank 1.6% on Tuesday, with investors digesting the potential impact of rising geopolitical tensions amid the Israel-Hamas war and Houthi rebel attacks on ships carrying freight in the Red Sea, a critical trade route. Surging oil prices and broken supply chains because of conflict in the Middle East could lead inflation to be stickier than previously anticipated, which might force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high, weighing on growth-focused tech stocks.
Story continues
There have also been warning signs about waning iPhone demand for some time—and that’s critical given that iPhone sales made up nearly 50% of Apple’s total revenue in the 
third quarter
 of 2023.
UBS analyst David Vogt, who holds a neutral rating and $190 price target for Apple, warned in a Monday note that iPhone 15 sales have been “soft” in many key regions lately, including China and India.
Vogt explained that U.S. iPhone sales to end customers (called sell-through) fell almost 13% from a year ago in November, while China sales were down 6% over the same period. This led Apple to lose 50 basis points of global smartphone market share year over year in November, and 320 basis points of smartphone market share in China over the same period. “New competition is a challenge,” Vogt said of the data.
Regulatory challenges to Apple’s app store in the U.S. and EU are also weighing on investor sentiment. Apple’s $85 billion services business could face pressure due to a U.S. antitrust trial that revealed, among other things, 
Google
 pays 
tens of billions a year
 to maintain its standing as the default search engine on Apple’s devices.
“In 2024…some app store investigations could intensify,” Long wrote Monday, noting that the U.S. court’s decision over Google’s payments to Apple will come later this year.
As Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told the 
Financial Times 
last week, investors may have been ignoring antitrust risks in recent years, but as a number of high-profile cases wind their way through the courts, antitrust is no longer just “noise in the background.”
“I think investors should take it seriously,” he warned.

RACHELLE AKUFFO:
 Well, we're taking a look at Apple shares, still in negative territory this morning. Down more than 3%. This comes after Barclays downgraded the stock to underweight, and lowered its price target by $1. The bank's analyst Tim Long saying the current iPhone sales are lackluster, and there was a lack of bounce back in Macs, iPads, and wearables.
Our next guests are keeping an eye on Apple's performance and how the company will continue to engage with customers in the US and abroad. Let's bring in Gil Luria, D.A. Davidson managing director, as well as Martin Yang, Oppenheimer senior analyst of Emerging Technologies and Services. A big welcome to you both here.
So it's worth noting that in this note, they talked most specifically about the iPhone 15's performance in China, and really signaled that as broader weakness potentially for the iPhone 16, and some of the other hardware sales. So, Gil, I want to start with you here because you are in that same sort of camp in terms of having a neutral rating, and you have $166 price target. What concerns you most about the reports coming out from Apple?
Story continues
GIL LURIA:
 Well, it's not necessarily reports from this holiday season. We're not going to actually know how many iPhones they sold until they tell us. All these checks are very, very partial. There's a lot of moving pieces. There's a week less of sales, but there's better supply chain. There's restrictions in China, but there's some aging hardware in the market as well. So we're not going to actually know.
But what we do know is that growth isn't going to be very fast-- not for the iPhone, or for any of the other hardware categories Apple is really just growing its services business at this point, and that's not enough to generate any more than just low single-digit revenue growth this year, after a pretty flat year last year. That's our concern is that unless they unclog their innovation rut, then it's going to be very hard for this company to accelerate growth on the hardware side.
RACHELLE AKUFFO:
 Now, Martin, you have a $200 price target here. And you have an outperform rating, but when you look at the stock price reaction to this downgrade, do you think it's overblown, or do you think it's fairly justified?
MARTIN YANG:
 In the near-term, it's probably justified. We're seeing really deceleration of Apple's share gaining momentum in China and in developed markets in recent quarters. But in the longer term, I think it will correct itself because we do see a very stable active install base that will help to maintain a very strong service revenue growth for the longer term for Apple."

By Shristi Achar A and David French
Jan 2 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite dropped in the first trading session of 2024, weighed by a decline in Apple shares following a broker downgrade and a brief climb in Treasury yields as investors tempered interest-rate cut expectations.
The lackluster start follows a year where Wall Street's three major indexes notched double-digit gains on the back of optimism around artificial intelligence and stabilizing inflation. The S&P 500 ended last week within 1% of a record closing high reached in early 2022.
However, equities came under pressure on Tuesday as U.S. Treasury yields climbed. The yield on 10-year notes ticked above 4.000% to a two-week high before easing to 3.95%.
Apple fell 4% after Barclays downgraded the tech giant to ""underweight"", citing weakening iPhone demand. Other megacap stocks, including Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Microsoft shed between 1.8% and 3%.
""The losses right now are in tech, which was the biggest winner last year. It's not shocking that they came down a little,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading.
""What we saw in December was kind of a sloppy rally where people seem to be wanting to put things on their books maybe or cover shorts. That rally lasted a little bit too long.""
The S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq booked nine consecutive weekly gains on Friday - the longest weekly winning streak for the S&P 500 since January 2004, and the longest for the Dow and the Nasdaq since early 2019.
The Fed's December policy meeting minutes and a slew of labor market data are on the roster for this week as market participants look to ascertain the timing of potential rate cuts.
While the Fed is widely seen holding rates at its January meeting, traders expect a near 70% chance of a 25-basis point cut in March, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

At 1:54 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 30.21 points, or 0.08%, at 37,719.75, the S&P 500 was down 27.88 points, or 0.58%, at 4,741.95, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 250.64 points, or 1.67%, at 14,760.71.
Health stocks were among the best performing of the S&P 500 sectors, rising 1.7% to the index's highest level in a year. Energy was also a leading gainer, up 1.6%, despite crude slipping on concerns about the economic outlook.
Information technology led declines with a 2.8% drop.
Tesla traded flat despite saying it delivered a record number of electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, beating market estimates and meeting its 2023 target of 1.8 million vehicles.
Boeing shed 3.2% after Goldman Sachs removed the aerospace company from its ""conviction list"".
Meanwhile, Citigroup hit its highest level in 11 months, advancing 3.1% to $53, after Wells Fargo raised its price target for the bank to $70 from $60. Wells analyst Mike Mayo also said Citi was his top pick among large banks in 2024, and he expects the stock to double to $100+ over the next three years.
Crypto-related stocks such as Marathon Digital Holdings and MicroStrategy gained as bitcoin pierced above $45,000 for the first time since April 2022 on optimism around the possible approval of exchange-traded spot bitcoin funds.

Apple shares slumped by as much as 3.3pc after its stock was downgraded by analysts expecting “lacklustre” sales of iPhones.
The world’s largest company began 2024 with a blow to its share price after Barclays downgraded the iPhone maker’s stock to “underweight”.
Analysts said the stock had outperformed in 2023 despite a year when most quarterly targets were missed.
They were sceptical about the prospects for the iPhone 15, adding “we see no features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling”.
The Silicon Valley giant’s stock rose by 54pc last year but Barclays analysts said they expect further “lacklustre” sales for iPhones.
Meanwhile, Apple is battling competition from Huawei after China banned officials from using iPhones at work in a tit-for-tat battle with the US.

Yields on the benchmark 10-year UK bond rose over 15 basis points to 3.7pc, touching a more than two-week high, tracking moves in US Treasuries as investors moved away from higher risk assets.
The investment banking and brokerage services index led the losses with a 2.2pc fall, closely followed by a 1.9pc decline in life insurance stocks.

Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 completed its 40th trading year.
Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell, said: “The headline index has made almost no progress since the start of the century, and in the last decade the Footsie has been totally eclipsed by the US stock market.”
Pharma and biotech shares were the top performer, jumping 1.7pc, supported by a 1.8pc rise in AstraZeneca after the drugmaker’s respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunisation for infants developed with Sanofi got approval in China.
Oil and gas shares added 0.4pc as crude prices moved higher on the prospect of Middle Eastern supply disruptions after a naval clash in the Red Sea.

‘Lazy’ broadband engineers blamed for exposing hospitals and banks to cyber attacks
Hospitals and banks are more exposed to cyber attacks because “lazy” broadband engineers are failing to fill in crucial forms, it has been alleged.
Our media and telecoms reporter 
James Warrington
 has the details:
Industry sources warned of a “Wild West” among contractors who are not handing over information about when and where they are working on 
BT’s network
.
This leaves companies blind to who has access to critical network infrastructure, the sources claimed, allowing saboteurs to take advantage.
In one incident in late October, a hospital and financial institution in central London were taken offline after someone gained access to the network and cut through a cable.
Another incident in August saw two people use a van to tear broadband cables out of the ground.

Mortgage bills fall £160 a month amid ‘unprecedented’ rate war
Lenders have kicked off a new year “mortgage rates war” amid hopes the Bank of England will cut borrowing costs.
Our money reporter
 Ruby Hinchliffe
 has the latest:
One of Britain’s biggest mortgage providers, Halifax, 
cut the rates on some of its mortgages
 by as much as 0.92 percentage points Tuesday – equivalent to £162 a month on a £300,000 loan with 25 years’ of repayments left.
Leeds Building Society also cut rates by 0.49 percentage points and is now offering a two-year fix at 4.60pc, according to analyst Moneyfacts.
Other lenders, such as Kensington, have withdrawn rates with a view to re-launch cheaper loans.
Mortgage broker Ranald Mitchell, of Charwin Private Clients, said the “unprecedented rate war is well underway” in 2024 and that “seismic moves” were to be expected compared to last year.

Apple downgraded over 'lacklustre' iPhone sales
Apple shares slumped by more than 3.3pc after its stock was downgraded by analysts expecting “lacklustre” sales of iPhones.
The world’s largest company began 2024 with a blow to its share price after Barclays downgraded the iPhone maker’s stock to “underweight”.
Analysts said the stock had outperformed in 2023 despite a year when most quarterly targets were missed.
They were sceptical about the prospects for the iPhone 15, adding “we see no features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling”.
The Silicon Valley giant’s stock rose by 54pc last year but Barclays analysts said they expect further “lacklustre” sales for iPhones.
Meanwhile, Apple is battling competition from Huawei after China banned officials from using iPhones at work in a tit-for-tat battle with the US.

Chevron to take up to £3.2bn hit on US assets
Oil giant Chevron said it would take an accounting hit on part of its US assets and recognise some losses, hitting its fourth quarter results by up to $4bn (£3.2bn).
The impairment of US assets, mainly in California, was “due to continuing regulatory challenges in the state,” while the loss relates to oil and gas production assets sold in the US Gulf of Mexico, the company said.
The regulatory difficulties resulted in lower anticipated future investment levels in its business plans, Chevron said.
But it expects to keep running the assets for “many years to come”.
Meanwhile, the loss involves “abandonment and decommissioning obligations,” after companies that bought the production assets filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code.
The decommissioning activities are to take place over the coming decade.
The actions are, in total, estimated to result in charges of $3.5bn to $4bn in Chevron’s fourth quarter 2023 results.
Chevron shares rose 0.6pc in New York.

Bond markets slump as traders trim bets on interest rate cuts
Government borrowing costs have leapt at their fastest pace since September today as traders trim their bets on the number of interest rate cuts this year.
Bond markets slumped steeply as money markets pulled back their expectations of rate cuts this year.
The yield on benchmark 10-year UK gilts - the return the Government promises to pay buyers of its debt - rose by more than 15 basis points to 3.69pc, its largest jump since September.
It comes as money markets have reduced bets on the level of interest rate cuts this year.
Before today, traders had priced in cuts from their 16-year highs of 5.25pc to 3.75pc but volatile trading has seen bets cut below that level at times.

US markets fall at first opening bell of 2024
Wall Street’s main indexes fell at the open, kicking off 2024 on a dull note.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 123.32 points, or 0.3pc, at the open to 37,566.22.
The S&P 500 opened lower by 24.63 points, or 0.5pc, at 4,745.20, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 137.65 points, or 0.9pc, to 14,873.70 at the opening bell.

Pound slumps as food price inflation eases
The pound has dropped against the resurgent dollar as it was also hit by the latest signs of slowing inflation in Britain.
Sterling was last down 0.9pc at $1.26, as a move up in US yields sent the greenback higher.
The pound gained more than 5pc in 2023 amid expectations the Bank of England would keep rates higher for longer.
However, a weakening economy and election uncertainty make a repeat performance unlikely.
The pound was flat against the euro at 86p.
It comes as food price inflation rose at the 
joint slowest pace in a year and a half
 in December, according to the British Retail Consortium.
Markets are fully pricing a first Bank of England rate cut by May, with trades implying rates will drop t nearly 3.75pc by the end of the year.

Tesla loses electric car crown to China's BYD
Tesla delivered more vehicles than expected in the last three months of 2023 but dropped behind China’s BYD in global electric car sales.
Tesla handed over 484,507 vehicles in the fourth quarter, which was ahead of analyst estimates of 483,173.
However, BYD sold 526,409 fully electric vehicles during the same period, driven by its cheaper models in China.
It means BYD takes Tesla’s crown as the number one seller of electric vehicles in the world.

UK not planning to send more 'assets' to Red Sea, says No 10
The Government does not plan to send “additional assets” to patrol the Red Sea, Downing Street said, as it condemned the “destabilising” attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels.
Asked whether more warships could join HMS Diamond in the region, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said:
You will appreciate, given the operational nature of this, I can’t get into a lot of detail.
Planning is under way for a range of scenarios. No decisions have been made. We will continue to pursue all potential routes, including diplomatic routes.
The Houthis should be under no misunderstanding, we are committed to holding malign actors accountable for unlawful seizures and attacks because the situation in the Red Sea is serious. These attacks are unacceptable, they are destabilising.
The UK is part of Operation Prosperity Guardian, which is the taskforce working in the region, and we have other assets available.
In terms of other military assets, there are not currently any plans to send additional assets over and above what we already have in the region.

'Side hustle' tax rules come into force
Online sellers making money from second-hand goods or homeowners who let out their spare rooms are among those who could end up paying tax on their “side-hustle” earnings under a New Year tax clampdown.
From January 1, digital platforms such as eBay, Airbnb, Etsy, Amazon and Vinted must share seller information with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) as part of a crackdown, dubbed the side hustle tax.
This will allow tax authorities to detect and tackle tax evasion, while also levelling the playing field with how traditional businesses are treated for tax purposes, according to HMRC.
It comes amid a number of tax changes for the start of 2024, including changes to the national insurance rate that employees pay.
The threshold for earnings from so-called online side hustles is set at more than £1,000 a year - above this, online sellers must register as self-employed and file a self-assessment tax return at the end of the financial year.

Oil pushes higher as Middle East tensions grow
Oil has continued to move higher after Iran sent a warship into the Red Sea, escalating Middle East tensions.
Brent crude has climbed more than 2pc toward $79, while US-produced West Texas Intermediate has risen above $73 a barrel.
The deployment of an Iranian warship comes after the US Navy said it was fired upon when responding to a distress call from a vessel in the Red Sea.
Defence and shipping stocks were also trading higher, with aerospace and defence companies across the FTSE 350 hitting a record high.
Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS Group, said: “The latest events in the Red Sea, positive sentiment in European equity markets and the new Chinese import quotas are likely pushing crude higher.”

Bond yields lurch higher amid thin trading
Government borrowing costs have jumped higher on a day of thin trading, as bond traders recalibrate bets on how steep the Bank of England will cut interest rates.
Money markets are pricing in more than one and a half percentage points of interest rate cuts in Britain this year from 5.25pc to 3.75pc but bond traders are not so sure.
The yield on 10-year UK gilts has risen 14 basis points to 3.66pc in the largest lurch upward across Europe.  However, it remains down 76 basis points over the last six months.
Meanwhile, Germany’s 10-year yield, the benchmark for the eurozone, has fallen 34 basis points over the last six months, having enjoyed its largest drop since 2014 over the whole of 2023. It is up seven basis points today to 2.09pc.
Much of the sharp movement in prices has been put down to thin trading as investors return from the New Year holiday.

Gas prices ease despite impending cold snap
Wholesale gas prices have fallen despite forecasts that temperatures will drop across Europe in the coming days.
The European benchmark contract has fallen 1.5pc to less than €32 per megawatt hour, while the UK equivalent has dropped 1.3pc below 80p per therm.
It comes amid lower industrial gas consumption and high storage levels across the continent.
This has offset the impact of the impending colder weather, with temperatures forecast to fall to 5C by Sunday in London.

Wall Street on track to slump at start of new year
US stock indexes slipped in premarket trading, setting a sombre tone for the first trading day of 2024.
The three major US stock indexes notched monthly, quarterly and annual gains as traders priced in higher chances of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year on the back of cooling inflation.
For 2023, the benchmark S&P 500, the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the blue-chip Dow posted double-digit gains. The S&P 500 closed on Friday within 1pc of its record closing high reached on January 3, 2022.
However, US stock futures came under pressure today, with Apple falling 1.2pc in premarket trading after a report from thefly.com said Barclays downgraded the iPhone maker’s stock.
Meanwhile, the yield on 10-year US Treasury notes , a benchmark for global borrowing costs, ticked above 4pc to a two-week high earlier in the session before easing to 3.94pc.
Ahead of the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3pc, the S&P 500 had lost 0.4pc and the Nasdaq 100 was down 0.7pc.

Maersk to decide on resuming shipping through Red Sea
Maersk will decide today whether to resume sending vessels through the Suez Canal via the Red Sea or redirect them around Africa following a weekend attack on one of its ships, a company spokesman said.
The container shipping giant on Sunday paused all Red Sea sailings for 48 hours following attempts by Yemen-based Houthi militants to board the Maersk Hangzhou. US military helicopters repelled the assault and killed 10 of the attackers.
Maersk had more than 30 container vessels set to sail through Suez via the Red Sea, an advisory on Monday showed, while 17 other voyages were put on hold.
A decision will be taken today regarding how to proceed, the company spokesman said.
The Iranian-backed Houthis, who control parts of Yemen after years of war, started attacking international shipping in November in support for Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in its war with Israel in the Gaza Strip.
Major shipping groups, including Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd , last month stopped using Red Sea routes, instead taking the longer journey around southern Africa via the Cape of Good Hope.

UK manufacturers 'excited by growth prospects,' analysts insist
After Britain’s manufacturing sector suffered a seventeenth consecutive monthly downturn, Dave Atkinson of Lloyds Bank said:
Manufacturers are entering the new year with a bit of a hangover from the challenges of 2023.
Despite this, many of those we speak to tell us they’ve become more agile at dealing with the headwinds posed by high input costs and energy bills.
They’re also excited by the potential growth prospects provided by reshoring, new technologies and the green economy, with our latest Business Barometer reporting that the majority of firms expect their activity to increase over the next 12 months, as the sector looks to move onto more robust footing as early as possible in 2024.

Factory bosses 'decidedly gloomy' as manufacturing downturn deepens
British manufacturing production declined for a 17th successive month in December amid declines in production and growing job losses, a closely-watched survey showed.
S&P Global UK Manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell back more sharply than expected to 46.2 in December - after hitting a seven-month high of 47.2 in November.
Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said:
The downturn has hit manufacturers’ confidence, which dipped to its lowest level in a year, and encouraged renewed cost caution with further cutbacks to stock levels, purchasing and employment.
With concerns about high interest rates and the cost-of-living crisis hurting demand, the outlook for manufacturers in the months ahead remains decidedly gloomy.
The downturn in demand is having some positive effects on supply chains, however, with suppliers reducing their prices for raw materials and vendor lead times showing a further improvement.

France suffers worst manufacturing downturn since 2020
Manufacturing continued its slump in the eurozone at the end of last year as output fell and job losses extended for a seventh successive months, according to a closely-watched survey.
The HCOB Eurozone Manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI), rose marginally in December to 44.4, from 44.2 in November. It was its best performance in seven months.
France recorded its largest worsening of business conditions in three-and-a-half years in December, although the downturns in German and Italian manufacturing eased.
Greece was the solitary area of improvement, with growth edging up to a four-month high.

Oil prices rise amid escalating tensions in the Red Sea
The price of oil has moved higher after Iran sent a warship into the Red Sea.
Brent crude oil has risen 1.9pc in early trading toward $79 a barrel as tensions escalate in the vital shipping route.
Iran dispatched its warship in response to the US Navy’s sinking of three Houthi boats over the weekend.
The US Navy said it came under fire as it responded to a distress call in the Red Sea.
Attacks by the Houthi rebels in Yemen have forced shipping companies to send their vessels around the south of Africa rather than through the waterway linking the Arabian Sea with the Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal.
Iran’s Alborz destroyer entered the Red Sea on Monday, state media said.
Priyanka Sachdeva, senior market analyst at brokerage Phillip Nova, said: “Ongoing geopolitical tensions are anticipated to provide support to prices.”

China stocks suffer worst day in four years amid ‘fragile’ economy
China stocks kicked off the year with their worst day since 2019 after a slowdown in manufacturing and home sales.
The CSI 300 Index fell 1.3pc in Asian trading as weak data triggered concerns about a “fragile” recovery in the world’s second largest economy.
The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong sank 1.5pc to 16,788.55 and the Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.4pc to 2,962.28.
Investors were selling property developers like debt-laden China Evergrande, which fell 6pc, and LongFor Group Holding, which lost 6.9pc. Sino-Ocean Holding declined 4.6pc.
It comes after the December survey of the official purchasing managers index, or PMI, in China fell for the third consecutive month  to 49, signalling weak demand.
That contrasted with a private-sector survey, by financial publication Caixin, which registered a slight improvement in the manufacturing PMI to 50.8, driven by increased output and new orders. However, it showed that business confidence for 2024 remained subdued.
The latest data also showed that the value of new home sales by China’s top 100 developers fell nearly 35pc from a year earlier in December despite moves by regulators to lift limits on such transactions.
Christopher Wong, a currency strategist at OCBC, said: “The divergence in manufacturing PMIs highlights how fragile the China recovery story is.”

The blue-chip index was up 0.2pc, touching a seven-month high, while the midcap index FTSE 250 edged down 0.1pc.
Energy shares climbed 1pc after oil prices jumped 1.4pc as a result of potential supply disruptions in the Middle East and expectations of an economic stimulus from China, the world’s top crude importer.

Somalia to hold emergency meeting after Red Sea deal between Somaliland and Ethiopia
Somalia will hold an emergency cabinet meeting today, state media said, after the breakaway region of Somaliland struck a controversial deal with Ethiopia giving it access to the Red Sea.
Monday’s surprise pact has triggered fury in Mogadishu, which considers it a violation of its sovereignty.
It was announced only days after Somalia’s central government had agreed to resume dialogue with the separatist northern region after years of stalemate.
Somaliland has been seeking full statehood since claiming independence from Somalia in 1991, a move fiercely opposed by Mogadishu and not recognised internationally.
The Addis Ababa agreement gives landlocked Ethiopia long-desired access to the Red Sea, a key waterway for global trade.
“This historic agreement ensures Ethiopia’s access to the Red Sea for their naval forces, reciprocated by formal recognition of the Republic of Somaliland, marking this as a significant diplomatic milestone for our country,” Somaliland’s foreign ministry said in a statement.
Somali National Television said on X, formerly Twitter, that there would an emergency cabinet meeting on Tuesday to discuss the agreement.

Bitcoin breaks $45,000 amid hopes for wider trading
Bitcoin stormed above $45,000 (£35,300) for the first time since April 2022 amid hopes that regulators will approve wider trading methods for the world’s largest cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin touched a 21-month peak of $45,532 (£35,737) as expectations grow that the US Securities and Exchange Commission will soon approve exchange-traded spot bitcoin funds.
Hayden Hughes, co-founder of social-trading platform Alpha Impact, said much of the rise was down to the fear of missing out, with investors “buying on January 1, first thing New Year’s morning”.
Cici Lu McCalman, founder of blockchain adviser Venn Link Partners, suggested a major correction in the price is unlikely given the broader bullish sentiment and the upcoming halving.
Halving is the process that cuts the quantity of bitcoin that miners receive in half every few years.

Asian stocks slump amid ‘fragile’ China recovery
Asian markets started the year with little fanfare, with Hong Kong and Shanghai extending their 2023 losses.
The Hang Seng Index lost 1.9pc, having ended 2023 with a yearly loss of close to 14pc, making it one of the world’s worst performing stock markets.
Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite closed down 0.4pc at 2,962.28, and there were also losses in Mumbai, Singapore and Taipei, although Sydney, Seoul, Manila, Bangkok and Jakarta rose.
A private-sector survey today showed China’s factory activity expanded at a quicker pace in December due to stronger gains in output and new orders, but business confidence for 2024 remained subdued.
That contrasted with official data released over the weekend, which showed China’s manufacturing activity shrank for a third straight month in December and weakened more than expected.
Christopher Wong, a currency strategist at OCBC, said:
The divergence in manufacturing PMIs highlights how fragile the China recovery story is.

AAPL
) fell 3.6% at the close of trading in New York on Tuesday, the stock's steepest drop since August. The moves came after Barclays downgraded the iPhone maker and lowered its price target for shares of the company on fears of slowing iPhone 15 sales in China.
“We are still picking up weakness on iPhone volumes and mix, as well as a lack of bounce-back in Macs, iPads and wearables,” Barclays analyst Tim Long wrote in a note Tuesday.
“The biggest takeaway from the latest checks is incrementally worse [iPhone 15] data points out of China, together with developed markets remaining soft,” he added.
According to Long, the softness in iPhone sales is likely to continue even after Apple launches the iPhone 16 later this year, as the phone isn’t expected to have many major upgrades over the current model.
Apple’s iPhone revenue declined roughly $5 billion in 2023 versus 2022. Sales of the company’s Macs, iPads, and wearables were also off, as consumers felt pressure from rising inflation and interest rates. The PC industry was also stung as fewer consumers needed to purchase new systems after millions bought up laptops and desktops at the start of the pandemic.
Long also called out Apple’s services business as a potential weak link for the company, saying that the segment faces a number of battles ahead including those related to its App Store practices. Apple is facing pressure to allow app developers to offer users a means of paying for apps via third-party payment options that would cut out Apple’s 30% App Store fee.

The company’s deal to use Google as the default search engine in its Safari browser could also be under threat as the Department of Justice continues its antitrust case against the search giant. Apple is estimated to rake in billions on the deal, which is reported under the services business.
Apple’s service business, on the other hand, jumped from $78.1 billion in 2022 to $85.2 billion in 2023. Long, however, says that the segment will start to see growth slow in the coming years.

“We model ~10% and ~8% growth in services in FY24 and FY25, well below [the] prior growth estimate of ~20%. In 2024, we should get an initial determination on the Google TAC, and some app store investigations could intensify,” Long wrote.

At the same time, Apple is continuing to fight its patent battle with medical device maker Masimo over whether the Apple Watch’s blood oxygen sensor infringes on Masimo’s patents related to the technology.
Apple initially pulled its Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 from store shelves ahead of Christmas after the International Trade Commission called for a ban on imports of the watches. But a federal appeals court ruled Apple could continue selling the watches while the dispute works its way through the court system.
Despite those potential troubles, Apple has a major bright spot on the horizon: its Vision Pro headset. Apple is expected to host a launch event for the AR/VR headset sometime in February. And if the Vision Pro, which Apple refers to as a spatial computer, is a success, it could set up Apple as the go-to company for a new generation of computing devices.

(Updated at 11:38 a.m. ET)
By Sruthi Shankar and Shristi Achar A
Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on the first trading session of 2024 after Apple shares dropped on a broker downgrade and Treasury yields climbed as investors tempered expectations around interest-rate cuts this year.
The lackluster start follows a year where Wall Street's three major indexes notched double-digit gains on the back of optimism around artificial intelligence and stabilizing inflation. The S&P 500 ended last week within 1% of a record closing high reached in early 2022.
However, equities came under pressure on Tuesday as U.S. Treasury yields climbed. The yield on 10-year notes ticked above 4.000% to a two-week high before easing to 3.929%.
Apple fell 2.7% after Barclays downgraded the tech giant to ""underweight"", citing weakening iPhone demand. Other megacap stocks including Nvidia and Microsoft shed 2.8% and 1.5%, respectively.
""The losses right now are in tech, which was the biggest winner last year. It's not shocking that they came down a little,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading.
""What we saw in December was kind of a sloppy rally where people seem to be wanting to put things on their books maybe or cover shorts. That rally lasted a little bit too long.""
The S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq booked nine consecutive weekly gains on Friday - the longest weekly winning streak for the S&P 500 since January 2004, and the longest for the Dow and the Nasdaq since early 2019.
The Fed's December policy meeting minutes and a slew of labor market data are on the roster for this week as market participants look to ascertain the timing of potential rate cuts.
Story continues
While the Fed is widely seen holding rates at its January meeting, traders expect a near 70% chance of a 25-basis point cut in March, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.
At 11:38 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 13.25 points, or 0.04%, at 37,676.29, the S&P 500 was down 26.72 points, or 0.56%, at 4,743.11, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 203.91 points, or 1.36%, at 14,807.44.
Health stocks outperformed the 10 other S&P 500 sectors, rising 1.4%, while information technology led declines with a 2.3% drop.
Tesla inched up 0.8% as it delivered a record number of electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, beating market estimates and meeting its 2023 target of 1.8 million vehicles.
Boeing shed 2.6% after Goldman Sachs removed the aerospace company from its ""conviction list"".
Crypto-related stocks such as Marathon Digital Holdings and MicroStrategy gained as bitcoin stormed above $45,000 for the first time since April 2022 on optimism around the possible approval of exchange-traded spot bitcoin funds.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.24-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and 1.07-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded 17 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 59 new highs and 35 new lows.

That streak came to an end in 2023, however.
For the first time since it introduced its tablet, 
Apple
 did not roll out a new model last year. The last time the company updated the line was in October 2022.
That drought is expected to end later this year, with the rumor mill suggesting a refresh on the entire product line, from entry-level iPads to a new flagship iPad Pro, which is expected to receive several new features, ranging from a better screen to a new keyboard attachment.
The new iPads could be introduced as early as March.
Part of the reason for the interruption in new iPads, 
per Bloomberg
, was Apple’s desire to make it easier for consumers to differentiate between models. The wide variety of models has resulted in a sales slowdown for the iPad. In fiscal 2023, sales of the tablet were 
down 3% compared to fiscal 2022
. The year before, they saw an 8% decline.
The pause in new iPads also comes as Apple is working to 
add touch screens to its Mac computers
, a decision that cofounder Steve Jobs once rejected and one the company previously worried could cannibalize iPad sales.
The company is also facing issues with its successful Apple Watch line, which is in the midst of a legal battle over a patent infringement battle with Masimo. An 
import ban
 went into effect late last year but was quickly 
paused by an appeals court
.
Apple could use some good news. On the first day of trading in 2024, the company’s stock was down more than 3% in late morning trading. That followed a downgrade from 
Barclays
, which cited a slowdown in iPhone sales, particularly in China. The drop wiped out over $100 billion of Apple’s market value.

Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on the first trading day of 2024 as Apple shares dipped on a broker downgrade and Treasury yields climbed after investors tempered expectations around interest-rate cuts this year.
Wall Street's three major indexes notched monthly, quarterly and annual gains on Friday as traders priced in higher chances of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year. The S&P 500 ended last week within 1% of a record closing high reached on Jan. 3, 2022.
However, equities came under pressure on Tuesday as the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, ticked above 4.0000% to a two-week high, before easing to 3.9388%.
Megacap stocks including Nvidia and Microsoft shed 3.5% and 1.7%, respectively. Apple fell 3.3% after Barclays downgraded the tech giant to ""underweight"", citing weaker iPhone demand.
""It's day one after a tremendous run. When you think about what happened from the October lows to now, I would expect the first three months of this year to be tough and this week to be somewhat exemplary of that, with people taking profits, realigning portfolios,"" said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management.
""It's going to be about interest rates in these first few days of the year.""
The CBOE Volatility index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, touched a near two-week high at 14.23 points.
At 9:45 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 70.22 points, or 0.19%, at 37,619.32, the S&P 500 was down 34.90 points, or 0.73%, at 4,734.93, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 224.07 points, or 1.49%, at 14,787.29.
Story continues
Health stocks outperformed the 10 other S&P 500 sectors, rising 1%, while information technology led declines with a 2.5% drop.
After optimism around artificial intelligence and stabilizing interest rates powered U.S. stocks in 2023, more inflation data and looming presidential elections will put further market gains to the test.
Weekly jobless claims, monthly private and non-farm payrolls data as well as services sector data are on the roster for the week. On Tuesday, the S&P Global's final reading of U.S. manufacturing activity for December came in at 47.9, compared with earlier estimates of 48.2.
Market participants are also awaiting the Fed's December policy meeting minutes, due on Wednesday, to ascertain the timing of potential rate cuts.
While the Fed is widely seen holding rates at its January meeting, traders expect a near 70% chance of a 25-basis point cut in March, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.
Companies linked to cryptocurrencies gained as bitcoin stormed above $45,000 for the first time since April 2022, on optimism around the possible approval of exchange-traded spot bitcoin funds.
Marathon Digital Holdings and MicroStrategy jumped 8.9% and 13%.
Boeing shed 1.4% after Goldman Sachs removed the aerospace company from its ""conviction list"".
Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.81-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.61-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded 10 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 27 new highs and 15 new lows.

The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.
Top Upgrades: 
Wells Fargo upgraded 
Booking Holdings 
(BKNG)
 and Expedia 
(EXPE)
 to Equal Weight from Underweight with price targets of $3,459 and $159, up from $2,402 and $91, respectively. The firm believes gross booking estimates for the company are achievable and says its competitive intensity thesis did not play out in 2023.
Stephens upgraded 
American Express 
(AXP)
 to Equal Weight from Underweight with a price target of $193, up from $148. With management having already implicitly guided to a 2024 guidance miss on a December webcast, investors are now focused on 2025 estimates, when American Express can return to its historical revenue and earnings growth targets year-over-year, the firm tells investors in a research note.
Oppenheimer upgraded 
Moderna 
(MRNA)
 to Outperform from Perform with a $142 price target. The firm sees ""increasing visibility"" on the company's COVID-19 vaccine sales and says catalysts in 2024 and 2025 give it reason to believe Moderna could be a five-product commercial company by 2026.
Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded 
Sprout Social
 
(SPT)
 to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $74, up from $48. The firm expects Sprout's story to become much cleaner in 2024, which makes its current valuation attractive.
BofA upgraded 
Doximity 
(DOCS)
 to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $29, up from $21. The firm thinks earnings expectations have been appropriately reset and that pharma manufacturer budgets could begin to improve over the next year as pressure from higher interest rates begins to ease.
Top Downgrades:
Barclays downgraded 
Apple 
(AAPL)
 to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $160, down from $161. The firm expects ""reversion"" in 2024 after a year when most quarters were missed and the stock outperformed
Deutsche Bank downgraded 
Estee Lauder
 
(EL)
 to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $146. The firm continues to see long-term upside should Hainan and Korea inventories clear as anticipated by April 1, but also sees near-term downside risk should Estee's China inventory recovery progress encounter delays and/or U.S. market conditions continue to slow.
Evercore ISI downgraded 
Southwest 
(LUV)
 to In Line from Outperform with a $35 price target. While fuel prices ended on a more manageable note despite geopolitical risks, Evercore is taking the over on ex-fuel unit costs and the under on capacity growth into 2024.
Piper Sandler downgraded 
Unity 
(U)
 to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $35, up from $20. The stock rose 35% in one month and 43% in 2023, which leaves ""little margin for error,"" the firm says. Piper Sandler also downgraded BlackLine 
(BL)
 to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $60, up from $53.
DA Davidson downgraded 
Hasbro 
(HAS)
 to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $53, down from $60. While citing valuation for the downgrade with the shares up 20% in two months, the firm also cut its below-consensus estimates.

(Reuters) -Apple on Tuesday fell nearly 3.6% to a seven-week low after Barclays downgraded the shares of the world's most valuable company on concerns that demand for its devices from the iPhone to the Mac will remain weak in 2024.
Barclays is the second brokerage to have the equivalent of a ""sell"" rating on the stock, which now has its most number of bearish recommendations in at least two years, according to LSEG data.
The stock accounts for a hefty 7% of the S&P 500's market weight - the broader index was dragged 0.56%% lower on Tuesday. Apple rose nearly 50% in 2023, hitting a record high in mid-December in a year when Big Tech led the markets.
Apple has been grappling with a demand slowdown since early last year and has forecast holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates. Its performance in China has also been a worry after the revival of local rival Huawei.
""The iPhone 15 has been lackluster and we believe iPhone 16 should be the same,"" Barclays analyst Tim Long said in a client note, pointing to the China weakness as well as subdued demand in developed markets.
Long is rated four out of five stars for his recommendation accuracy on Apple, according to LSEG data.
The brokerage also warned risks were mounting for Apple's services business, which has come under the scanner in countries including the United States over app store practices.
The business has often outpaced growth in Apple's hardware segment in recent years and now accounts for nearly a quarter of the company's total revenue.
The stock rout on Tuesday erased more than $100 billion of Apple's market capitalization, as its shares closed at $185.64.
Barclays downgraded the stock to ""underweight"" from ""neutral"" and trimmed its 12-month price target by $1 to $160. Before Tuesday, Itau BBA's ""sell"" was the only bearish rating on Apple since July 2022.
Analysts, on average, rate the iPhone maker ""buy"", with a median price target of $200. The company trades at about 28.7 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, much higher than the S&P 500's 19.8.

SEANA SMITH:
 Now the tech giant getting hit today with a rare downgrade. Barclays slashing its rating on the company to underweight, cutting its price target by about $1 now, citing weaker demand for the very new iPhone 15. The analysts behind that call, Tim Long, writing, quote, ""Our checks remain negative on volumes and mix for iPhone 15. And we see no features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling."" And Mady, I actually just talked to Tim long a few weeks ago.
And I asked him about Apple. And he has long had a bearish view on Apple and a lot of the demand that we are seeing from the iPhone, the fact that the demand just is not met expectations, being a huge headwind here for the tech giant. He doesn't think the iPhone 16 is going to be any different too, just in terms of some of that reception and lack of excitement that we're seeing right now with the iPhone 15.
MADISON MILLS:
 Well, it's great that we have that insight from you from him, because I'm so curious about this, particularly given that it's just a $1 change. But if you look at the market, it seems like a much bigger reaction than that. Having said that, this has been the story for Apple over the past 12 months. None of this is necessarily that new. We've been talking about waning demand, profits, revenues going down. And so the question for a while has been, is the market going to start to have some questions about the valuations, about the multiple expansions for a name like Apple? Is this going to be the year that those valuations start to matter?
SEANA SMITH:
 Yeah. Exactly. I mean, you take a look at Apple obviously. Shares up just about 50% in 2023 alone. You mentioned valuation. So many of these headwinds that are facing not only Apple but so many of these consumer facing stocks. When we take that all into account, the fact that that stock is still up about 50% and is disregarded or really brushed aside any of those concerns is really one of the reasons that Tim Long is saying, hey, maybe it's time that we do see a bit more downward pressure on shares moving forward, at least in the short term, when we're starting 2024 off with some concern already."
